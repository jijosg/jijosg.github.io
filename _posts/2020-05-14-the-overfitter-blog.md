I finally made up my mind to switch from Blogger and stick with Github pages instead of going with medium, so that atleast I can make my github graph look good ;) . I thought I will stick to github since i can track all my analytics and I want my content to reach out to anyone without logging.

I created the repo back in 2015 just to try out how I can create a blog using Jekyll. From now on I will try to post some quality content on my blog and probably migrate the content from the old blog here as well.

Have a great day!
