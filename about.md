I working as a Software Engineer II - AI Platforms at [Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com/en). 
I have always been fascinated by technology and especially tools for analysing and interpreting information.
I want to use this blog to help teach people new skills and the different issues I have faced.

I created this blog using [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) [Minima](https://jekyll.github.io/minima/) theme.
