title: About
---

I am a Senior Consultant at [EY](http://ey.com) working on
their big data team. I have always been fascinated by technology
and especially tools for analysing and interpreting information.
I want to use this website to help teach people new skills and the
different issues I have faced.

Before working at EY, I completed my Master's from BITS,Pilani & undergrad
from College of Engineering, Chengannur.

I created this blog using [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) [Minima](https://jekyll.github.io/minima/) theme and it was inspired from [Tom Preston-Werner](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) & [Joshua Lande](https://github.com/joshualande/joshualande.github.io/)
