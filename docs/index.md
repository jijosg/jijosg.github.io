Welcome to yet another blog (YAB) ðŸ˜† I dont know if thats a thing. 

With this blog I intend to keep notes of the issues I have faced and if time permits provide detailed references and guides to new tools and technologies. 
What you might find here are notes related to ***Distributed Computing and Cloud development.***  Find [here](https://github.com/databricks/koalas/pull/1622) my contribution to the koalas library which was then merged into [Spark](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32036)

You can get in touch with me on

I created this blog using [Mkdocs](http://mkdocs.org).
