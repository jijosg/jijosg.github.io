title: Welcome

With this blog I intend to help the lonely developers gain some peace of mind by giving insights into the the different issues they might face.  
I am working as a Software Engineer @ [Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com/en). 
I have always been fascinated by technology and especially tools for analysing and interpreting information.
I want to use this blog to help teach people new skills and the different issues I have faced. I have contributed to the opensource databricks/koalas library which has been merged to Apache Spark 3.1.0.

I created this blog using [Mkdocs](http://mkdocs.org).
