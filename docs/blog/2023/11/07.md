# Tkinter not working in wsl2

So even after applying all the fixes that you found in stackoverflow if tkinter still doesnot work for you, don't worry I am here 
to help.

First things first , even if you install tcl/tk library in WSL2 tkinter will not work with python3.11. This is the issue I faced.
I tried to fix things but couldn't reach anywhere. But it had worked for me before so I was really curious as to what is the issue.
Then I downgraded python to 3.8 and `voila` everything works now :)
You also might have to install `apt install python3-tk tk-dev` for the tk libraries.

Thanks for reading!
