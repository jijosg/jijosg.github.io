# Troubleshooting Tkinter in WSL2

If you have attempted various solutions from Stack Overflow and Tkinter still does not function correctly in WSL2, this guide aims to assist you.

## The Issue

Despite installing the `tcl/tk` library in WSL2, Tkinter may not work with Python 3.11. This was the issue encountered. Multiple fixes were attempted without success, although it had previously worked, prompting further investigation into the cause.

## The Solution

Downgrading Python to version 3.8 resolved the issue. Additionally, it may be necessary to install the Tk libraries using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-tk tk-dev
```

## Conclusion

Downgrading Python to version 3.8 and installing the required Tk libraries should address the issue.
